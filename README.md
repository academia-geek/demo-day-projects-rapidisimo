# Project:

The *Rapidisimo Project* is a web application, focused on the provision of messaging sending and receiving services.
This project meets the expectations of generating help for customers, users and administrators in which they can verify their product to send it to their customers, where they can follow it, and have more information about their messaging.
Very quickly, it fulfills the need to solve the connection that is not found in other applications today between the client and its supplier through our web platform for monitoring and reliability between these two parties; the project has a backend on the google cloud firebase platform and was tested with Jest and Enzyme, Agile methodology is also used.
using the kanban method as development tools (workflow is attached at the end of the readme).
